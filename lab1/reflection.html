  	<h1> week 1</h1>
  	<p> I can say that I was satisfied on my first week on USERDES class because from the beginning I am really interested in this subject, I love designing things although before this class, I don’t have someone to guide me in designing, that’s why I appreciate our professor because she keeps our class interactive while at the same time we also learn new things. I think I really was able to provide a creative idea on our elevator activity, because I never thought I would be designing those kinds of things which made me more interested in designing. Before this class, my understanding of ‘designing’ is limited to how it will be attracting to look at, it never crossed my mind that designing include the ‘how will it work’ part. The ambience on this class is very soothing. Having a professor who I can say that we can vibe with while providing us with knowledge is very fun to have. I am looking forward to having a lots of fun while learning.  </p>
